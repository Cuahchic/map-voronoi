# Creating 
Take a map image, use ML to turn it into a Voronoi map, then display it using D3.js.

The initial code for turning the map into a Voronoi diagram comes from [orlp on Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/50345).

## ToDo
(1) Any deprecated pakcages should be updated to their latest version
(2) Better image of chart without black border lines
(3) Unique identifier and metadata to each cell
(4) D3.js visualisation
